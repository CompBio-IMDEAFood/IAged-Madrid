<h1 style="color: green ; font-size: 24px;">Consultant in geriatric Medicine - assistant (1/1)</h1>

As the Consultant in Geriatric Medicine, I would like to offer the following insights and considerations for the manuscript:

1. **Clinical Relevance of GV as a Predictor:**
   - The finding that glycemic variability (GV) is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in older adults is significant. It underscores the importance of monitoring and managing GV in this population, particularly given the physiological changes and increased vulnerability associated with aging. This should be highlighted in the discussion as a key takeaway for clinicians.

2. **Age-Related Factors and Comorbidities:**
   - It's crucial to consider the role of age-related factors and common comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and renal impairment, which may interact with GV and influence mortality risk. These factors should be discussed in the context of the study's findings to provide a comprehensive understanding of the results.

3. **Practical Recommendations:**
   - Based on the results, practical recommendations for managing GV in older adults should be included. This could involve more frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels, personalized diabetes management plans, and consideration of the impact of polypharmacy. Emphasizing the need for individualized care plans that account for the unique needs of older adults is essential.

4. **Impact of COVID-19:**
   - The study's context during the COVID-19 pandemic adds an important dimension. The pandemic may have exacerbated health vulnerabilities in older adults, and this should be acknowledged. The manuscript should discuss how the pandemic might have influenced GV and mortality, potentially through changes in healthcare access, stress, and lifestyle factors.

5. **Addressing Confounding Factors:**
   - While the study has attempted to address confounding factors, it is important to acknowledge any residual confounding that may exist. This includes potential unmeasured variables such as socioeconomic status, nutritional status, and physical activity levels, which could influence both GV and mortality.

In conclusion, the manuscript should emphasize the clinical implications of GV as a predictor of mortality in older adults, the need for tailored management strategies, and the broader context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These elements will ensure that the findings are relevant and applicable to geriatric care.

If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.  (round1/1)

<h1 style="color: purple ; font-size: 24px;">Clinical Pharmacology Specialist - assistant (1/1)</h1>

As the Clinical Pharmacology Specialist, I would like to contribute the following insights and considerations for the manuscript:

1. **Impact of Polypharmacy:**
   - The study's findings on glycemic variability (GV) as an independent predictor of mortality should be interpreted in the context of polypharmacy, which is prevalent in older adults. The interaction between multiple medications and their potential to influence GV and mortality risk should be explored. This includes considering the effects of medications such as insulin, oral hypoglycemics, and other drugs that may impact glucose metabolism.

2. **Medication-Related Confounding Factors:**
   - It is important to address medication-related confounding factors in the analysis. The study should consider the potential effects of drug-drug interactions, adherence issues, and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics changes in older adults. These factors can significantly influence GV and should be accounted for in the interpretation of results.

3. **Pharmacological Implications for Management:**
   - The findings suggest a need for careful medication management in frail older adults, particularly those with multiple comorbidities. The manuscript should discuss the implications for prescribing practices, including the need for regular medication reviews and adjustments to minimize adverse effects and optimize glycemic control.

4. **Role of Specific Medications:**
   - The interaction between GV and specific medications, such as insulin, should be highlighted. The results indicate a significant GV-Insulin interaction, which warrants further exploration. Understanding how different classes of medications affect GV can inform more targeted therapeutic strategies.

5. **Consideration of Non-Pharmacological Interventions:**
   - While the focus is on pharmacological factors, it is also important to consider non-pharmacological interventions that can influence GV, such as dietary modifications and physical activity. These should be discussed as part of a comprehensive approach to managing GV in older adults.

In conclusion, the manuscript should emphasize the complex interplay between polypharmacy, medication-related factors, and GV in influencing mortality risk in older adults. By addressing these pharmacological considerations, the study can provide valuable insights for optimizing medication management and improving outcomes in this population.

<h1 style="color: brown ; font-size: 24px;">Endocrinologist - assistant (1/1)</h1>

As the Endocrinologist, I would like to offer the following insights and considerations for the manuscript:

1. **Robustness and Relevance of GV Metrics:**
   - The study's use of glycemic variability (GV) metrics, such as coefficients of variation and standard deviations for glucose and HbA1c, is appropriate and clinically relevant. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of glucose fluctuations, which are particularly important in older adults who may experience more pronounced variability due to physiological changes. The manuscript should highlight the robustness of these metrics and their relevance to clinical practice.

2. **Biological Plausibility of GV as a Predictor:**
   - The biological plausibility of GV as a predictor of mortality is supported by existing literature, which links high GV to increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. These mechanisms are particularly detrimental in older adults, who may have diminished physiological reserves. The manuscript should discuss these biological pathways to provide a deeper understanding of how GV contributes to mortality risk.

3. **Implications for Diabetes Management:**
   - The findings have significant implications for diabetes management in older adults. The manuscript should emphasize the importance of not only achieving target HbA1c levels but also minimizing GV to reduce mortality risk. This may involve individualized treatment plans that consider both pharmacological and lifestyle interventions.

4. **GV-Insulin Interaction:**
   - The significant interaction between GV and insulin use is noteworthy. It suggests that insulin therapy, while necessary for many older adults, may need to be carefully managed to avoid excessive GV. The manuscript should explore strategies for optimizing insulin regimens, such as using continuous glucose monitoring to tailor insulin dosing more precisely.

5. **Consideration of COVID-19 Context:**
   - The study's context during the COVID-19 pandemic is important, as the pandemic may have influenced GV through changes in healthcare access, stress, and lifestyle. The manuscript should discuss how these factors might have impacted the study's findings and consider the potential for similar impacts in future pandemics or healthcare disruptions.

In conclusion, the manuscript should emphasize the clinical importance of managing GV in older adults, the biological mechanisms linking GV to mortality, and the need for tailored diabetes management strategies. By addressing these aspects, the study can provide valuable insights for improving outcomes in this vulnerable population.

As the Epidemiologist & Biostatistician, I would like to provide the following insights and considerations for the manuscript:

1. **Statistical Modeling and Interpretation:**
   - The use of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models is appropriate for evaluating glycemic variability (GV) as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. The manuscript should detail the model assumptions, such as proportional hazards, and how they were tested and met. This transparency will enhance the credibility of the findings.

2. **Addressing Confounding and Bias:**
   - The study employed propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting to address confounding. These methods are robust for balancing covariates between groups, but it's important to acknowledge any residual confounding that may remain. The manuscript should discuss the potential for unmeasured confounders and how they might impact the results.

3. **Temporal Analysis and Pandemic Impact:**
   - The temporal analysis, including the use of ARIMA models, provides valuable insights into how GV and mortality relationships shifted during the pandemic. The manuscript should highlight these temporal dynamics and discuss how the pandemic may have influenced healthcare access, stress levels, and lifestyle factors, potentially affecting GV and mortality.

4. **Subgroup Analyses:**
   - The study's subgroup analyses, stratified by COVID-19 status and comorbidity levels, are crucial for understanding differential impacts. The manuscript should present these findings clearly, emphasizing any significant interactions or variations in GV's predictive power across different subgroups.

5. **Data Quality and Limitations:**
   - While the study utilized a large and comprehensive dataset, it's important to discuss any limitations related to data quality, such as missing data or potential biases in electronic health records. The manuscript should address how these limitations were managed and their potential impact on the study's conclusions.

6. **Future Research Directions:**
   - The manuscript should suggest future research directions, such as exploring non-linear relationships and additional temporal analysis techniques. These could provide further insights into the complex interactions between GV, mortality, and other factors in older adults.

In conclusion, the manuscript should emphasize the rigorous statistical methods used, the importance of addressing confounding and bias, and the insights gained from temporal and subgroup analyses. By doing so, the study can provide a comprehensive understanding of GV's role in predicting mortality in older adults, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
