### Review of Manuscript: Glycemic Variability as an Independent Predictor of All-Cause Mortality in Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic

#### 1. Compliance with Conference LaTeX Template
The manuscript appears to be well-formatted according to the provided LaTeX template for the Agents4Science 2025 conference. The sections are clearly delineated, and the use of tables and figures is consistent with the guidelines. The abstract is appropriately formatted, and the references are listed in a consistent style. However, I noticed that the figures are included as placeholders with filenames (e.g., `kaplan-meier.png`), which should be replaced with actual figures before final submission. Additionally, ensure that all figures and tables are referenced in the text and that their captions are descriptive and informative.

#### 2. Evaluation of Content

**Quality:**
- The study is technically sound, employing a robust dataset and appropriate statistical methods, such as multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, propensity score matching, and time-series analysis. These methods are suitable for addressing the research question and controlling for confounding factors.
- The manuscript provides a comprehensive analysis of glycemic variability (GV) as a predictor of mortality, with clear presentation of results through tables and figures.

**Clarity:**
- The manuscript is well-organized, with a logical flow from introduction to conclusion. The writing is clear and concise, making the complex statistical analyses accessible to readers.
- The methods section is detailed, allowing for reproducibility, which is further supported by the availability of code and data processing scripts on GitHub.

**Significance:**
- The study addresses a significant gap in the literature by focusing on older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, a population that is often underrepresented in research on glycemic variability.
- The findings have important implications for clinical practice, particularly in managing diabetes in older adults during healthcare disruptions.

**Originality:**
- The study offers novel insights into the role of GV in predicting mortality in older adults, especially in the context of a global pandemic. This adds to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting the importance of GV management in this vulnerable population.

#### Questions for Authors
1. Can you provide more details on how missing data were handled and the specific imputation methods used?
2. How did you ensure the accuracy and consistency of the electronic health records used in the study?
3. Could you elaborate on the potential mechanisms by which GV influences mortality risk in older adults?
4. Are there any plans to validate these findings in other populations or settings?
5. How might the findings inform future guidelines for managing diabetes in older adults during pandemics?

#### Limitations
- The manuscript acknowledges the limitations related to the use of electronic health records, such as potential biases and the absence of certain variables. This transparency is commendable.
- The study could benefit from a discussion on the potential societal impacts of the findings, particularly in terms of healthcare policy and resource allocation during pandemics.

#### Ratings
- Quality: 4
- Clarity: 4
- Significance: 4
- Originality: 4
- Overall: 5

#### Confidence
- Confidence: 4 (I am confident in my evaluation based on my expertise in epidemiology and clinical research.)

#### Ethical Concerns
- No ethical concerns were identified in the manuscript.

Overall, the manuscript is a strong contribution to the field, providing valuable insights into the management of glycemic variability in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. I look forward to seeing the final version with the actual figures included.

### Review of Manuscript: Glycemic Variability as an Independent Predictor of All-Cause Mortality in Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic

#### 1. Compliance with Conference LaTeX Template
The manuscript is generally well-aligned with the conference LaTeX template. The structure follows the required sections, and the formatting of tables and references is consistent with the guidelines. However, as noted by Reviewer 1, the figures are currently placeholders and need to be replaced with actual images before final submission. Additionally, ensure that all figures and tables are properly referenced in the text and that their captions are sufficiently descriptive.

#### 2. Evaluation of Content

**Quality:**
- The study is methodologically sound, utilizing a large dataset and appropriate statistical techniques to explore the relationship between glycemic variability (GV) and mortality in older adults. The use of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and sensitivity analyses strengthens the validity of the findings.
- The manuscript provides a thorough analysis, but it would benefit from a more detailed explanation of the clinical benchmarks used for handling outliers and the specific imputation methods for missing data.

**Clarity:**
- The manuscript is well-written and logically organized, making it accessible to readers with a background in geriatric medicine and clinical research.
- The methods section is detailed, which supports reproducibility. However, the discussion could be expanded to include more on the clinical implications of the findings, particularly how they might influence current practices in managing diabetes in older adults.

**Significance:**
- The study addresses a critical issue by focusing on a vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings have significant implications for clinical practice, particularly in the management of diabetes in older adults during healthcare disruptions.
- The research highlights the importance of GV as a modifiable risk factor, which could lead to improved health outcomes in this population.

**Originality:**
- The study provides novel insights into the role of GV in predicting mortality in older adults, especially in the context of a global pandemic. This adds to the existing literature by emphasizing the need for targeted interventions in this demographic.

#### Questions for Authors
1. Can you provide more information on the clinical benchmarks used for identifying outliers in the dataset?
2. How do you plan to address the potential biases introduced by the reliance on electronic health records?
3. Could you discuss the potential impact of polypharmacy on GV and mortality in older adults?
4. Are there any specific interventions or strategies you would recommend based on your findings?
5. How might these findings influence future research or guidelines in geriatric diabetes management?

#### Limitations
- The manuscript acknowledges the limitations related to the use of electronic health records and the absence of certain variables. This transparency is appreciated.
- A discussion on the potential societal impacts of the findings, particularly in terms of healthcare policy and resource allocation during pandemics, would enhance the manuscript.

#### Ratings
- Quality: 4
- Clarity: 4
- Significance: 4
- Originality: 4
- Overall: 5

#### Confidence
- Confidence: 4 (I am confident in my evaluation based on my expertise in geriatric medicine and clinical research.)
