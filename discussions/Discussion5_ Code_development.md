## Discussion 5: Code development

## User (Initial prompt)

This is the beginning of the code-development phase of the working session to provide a clear, script-based analysis pipeline, starting from raw EHR data and ending with ready-to-run scripts that compute the results of your study. Please assume that the database tables have been exported as CSV files, with each file named after its corresponding table, avoiding a direct connection to the database. You should save the data and results in directories .
You are working on a research project to evaluate whether GV is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients aged 75 years or older with and without COVID-19 who were followed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown importancia using statistical methods.Your research team is composed of the following members:
A Consultant in Geriatric Medicine, expert in clinical interpretation of biochemical metrics, primary care of elderly populations, involvement in aging research projects, and distinguishing intrinsic parametric variation from confounding factors and comorbidities related to aging. Their goal is Providing a geriatric clinical perspective to ensure results are relevant and applicable to older patients. Their role in the project will be Offer expertise on geriatric care and validate the clinical relevance of findings, interpreting results considering age-related factors and comorbidities.
A Clinical Pharmacology Specialist, expert in expertise in clinical pharmacology, polypharmacy in elderly populations, and the impact of medications on multimorbidity and mortality. Their goal is evaluate how pharmacological factors and polypharmacy influence outcomes in elderly populations and their implications for research findings. Their role in the project will be Provide insights on medication-related confounding factors, assess the relevance of pharmacological variables, suggest considerations for interpreting results in the context of elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, and collaborate with geriatricians to evaluate the impact of medication changes in frail older adults.
A Endocrinologist, expert in Acts as the reference expert in metabolism and endocrine disorders, particularly in glycemic control and its clinical, pharmacological, and physiological determinants. Their goal is provide specialized expertise in glucose metabolism and diabetes management, ensuring that the definition, measurement, and interpretation of glycemic variability (GV) are clinically sound and relevant to older adults. The endocrinologist will bridge the gap between statistical findings and their biological plausibility. Their role in the project will be Provides expert guidance on defining, measuring, and interpreting glycemic variability in older adults, ensuring biological plausibility and clinical relevance of the study’s findings.
A Epidemiologist & Biostatistician, expert in population health, statistical modeling and analysis methods in biomedical research. Their goal is understand population-level factors affecting clinical data and apply statistical techniques to evaluate data quality and utility. Their role in the project will be analyze demographic and epidemiological factors contributing to distribution shifts and provide statistical insights into data valuation methodologies.
A Clinical Data Scientist, expert in working with electronic health records and understanding their structure and limitations for healthcare data analysis and integration . Their goal is ensure the clinical relevance and applicability; also extract, preprocess, and ensure the quality and integrity of EHR data for analysis. Their role in the project will be provide insights and manage data extraction, preprocessing and feature engineering for diverse hospital datasets.
This is the methodology defined in the last meeting:
Data Extraction and Preprocessing:
- Extract relevant data from EHR, focusing on glycemic variability (GV), mortality, and COVID-19 status.
- Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies using imputation methods and criteria for outlier handling.
- Structure temporal data to capture changes over time, aligning data points to a common timeline for pre-pandemic and pandemic periods.
- Implement data validation steps, including cross-checking against clinical benchmarks and using data visualization to identify anomalies.

Variable Selection:
- Focus on glucose and HBa1C metrics for GV, demographic variables (age, sex), comorbidities, and medication use.
- Consider potential confounders and create composite variables to account for interactions between GV and clinical factors.

Feature Engineering:
- Calculate variability metrics such as coefficients of variation and standard deviations for GV.
- Explore interaction terms and use machine learning techniques like decision trees to identify non-linear relationships.

Statistical Modeling:
- Use multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate GV as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.
- Apply propensity score matching or inverse probability weighting to address confounding.
- Conduct subgroup analyses and stratify by key subgroups, such as COVID-19 status and comorbidity levels.
- Incorporate time-varying covariates and consider time-series analysis techniques like ARIMA or LSTM networks for temporal analysis.

Model Validation and Assumptions:
- Validate models and ensure assumptions are met, including checking proportional hazards in Cox models.
- Conduct sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of findings and explore different definitions of GV.

Integration and Collaboration:
- Continuous collaboration with clinical experts to ensure clinical relevance and interpretability of findings.
- Regular feedback loops with the clinical team to align analytical approaches with clinical priorities.
Based on the resolution of questions, the described methodology, and the list of scripts to be generated, the objective is to produce the scripts that will process the raw database data and generate results in tables and figures necessary to draw conclusions.This is the script-list (pipeline) to develop in this session: [('data_extraction_preprocessing.py', 'Clinical Data Scientist'), ('variable_selection.R', 'Epidemiologist & Biostatistician'), ('feature_engineering.py', 'Clinical Data Scientist'), ('cox_modeling.R', 'Epidemiologist & Biostatistician'), ('model_validation.py', 'Clinical Data Scientist'), ('temporal_analysis.py', 'Clinical Data Scientist'), ('integration_collaboration.py', 'Epidemiologist & Biostatistician'), ('requeriments_python.txt', 'Clinical Data Scientist'), ('requeriments_r.txt', 'Epidemiologist & Biostatistician'), ('README.md', 'Clinical Data Scientist'), ('config.yaml', 'Clinical Data Scientist')]
These are the doubts solved by the research team in the last meeting:- **Variable Metrics for Glycemic Variability (GV):**
  - Prioritize the coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) as key metrics for measuring GV.
  - Calculate these metrics using both fasting and postprandial glucose levels, as well as HbA1c variability over time.

- **Pharmacological Factors:**
  - Include medications affecting glucose metabolism (e.g., insulin, sulfonylureas) and those indirectly influencing GV (e.g., corticosteroids, beta-blockers) as potential confounders.
  - Consider a polypharmacy index or medication count to account for the impact of multiple medications.

- **Interaction and Stratification:**
  - Explore interaction terms between GV and specific medication classes to assess their modifying effects on the relationship between GV and mortality.
  - Stratify analysis by key medication groups to evaluate differential impacts on GV and mortality outcomes.

- **Clinical Context for GV Interpretation:**
  - Consider the presence of diabetes-related complications and patient frailty when interpreting GV in older adults.
  - Align GV interpretation with individualized diabetes management goals, recognizing that less stringent glycemic targets may be appropriate for some elderly patients.

- **Data Handling:**
  - Address missing data and outliers, particularly for GV and related variables, using appropriate imputation methods.
  - Structure data to capture temporal changes and align with pre-pandemic and pandemic periods for accurate analysis.
The material available for this objective consists of a database of electronic health records from 500,000 adults aged over 75 in Madrid. This database originates from a retrospective longitudinal study, covering medical variables recorded during the periods 2015–2019 and 2020–2022.
CSV files have been generated for each table from the database. Please consider using these files instead of connecting directly to the MySQL databaseThe available variables are detailed in a data dictionary, which specifies each table name (key) along with its corresponding list of column names (value). This is the data dictionary: {<dict_db}

Epidemiologist & Biostatistician will convene the meeting.Throughout the working session , the developers will develop the code individually for each scriptin each round.
Then, Epidemiologist & Biostatistician summarize the working session in detail to have notes for the draft.
Remind that the resultant code should generate output tables and plots.The scripts should be structured following a clear directory hierarchy to ensure organization and reproducibility. 

At a minimum, the project should include the following folders: (a) raw_data/, to store the original input files (e.g., CSVs, databases); 
(b) scripts/, to store all processing and analysis scripts; 
\(c) output/, to store processed data, results, and figures; 
(d) docs/, to store documentation, notes, or metadata; 
(e) logs/, to capture execution logs, if applicable; Make sure the scripts automatically create these folders (if they do not exist) before writing files. No files should be generated outside of these directories.

Please, Epidemiologist & Biostatistician convene the collaborative working session.

 - Data Extraction and Preprocessing: Extracted relevant data from CSV files, focusing on glycemic variability (GV), mortality, and COVID-19 status. Addressed missing values using median imputation for numerical columns and mode for categorical columns. Handled outliers using the IQR method. Structured temporal data to align with pre-pandemic and pandemic periods.

- Variable Selection: Selected key variables for analysis, including GV metrics (glucemia and HBa1C), demographic variables (age, sex), comorbidities, and medication use. Considered potential confounders and created composite variables to account for interactions between GV and clinical factors.

- Feature Engineering: Calculated additional GV metrics such as mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE). Explored interaction terms, particularly between GV and insulin use. Standardized features for modeling using a standard scaler.

- Statistical Modeling: Utilized multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate GV as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Included covariates such as GV metrics, demographic factors, comorbidities, and medication use. Conducted subgroup analyses and stratified by COVID-19 status and comorbidity levels.

- Model Validation: Validated the Cox model by checking proportional hazards assumptions using Schoenfeld residuals and conducting sensitivity analyses. Explored the robustness of findings by refitting models without certain interaction terms.

- Temporal Analysis: Conducted time-series analysis using ARIMA models to explore temporal patterns in GV metrics. Standardized time-series data and fitted ARIMA models to assess trends over time.

- Integration and Collaboration: Integrated results into a comprehensive report, ensuring continuous collaboration with clinical experts to align analytical approaches with clinical priorities. Feedback loops with geriatricians, pharmacologists, and endocrinologists were crucial for interpreting results in the context of elderly care.

- Future Directions: Suggested further exploration of non-linear relationships and interaction terms, consideration of additional temporal analysis techniques, and ongoing collaboration with clinical teams to refine and validate findings.
