# Discussion 1: Workflow design

## User
This is the beginning of a individual meeting to define a provisional workflow to pursue the aim of the project.

You are working on a research project to evaluate whether GV is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients aged 75 years or older with and without COVID-19 who were followed during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and its lockdown importancia using statistical methods.Your research team is composed of the following members:

A Consultant in Geriatric Medicine, expert in clinical interpretation of biochemical metrics, primary care of elderly populations, involvement in aging research projects, and distinguishing intrinsic parametric variation from confounding factors and comorbidities related to aging. Their goal is Providing a geriatric clinical perspective to ensure results are relevant and applicable to older patients. Their role in the project will be Offer expertise on geriatric care and validate the clinical relevance of findings, interpreting results considering age-related factors and comorbidities.

A Clinical Pharmacology Specialist, expert in expertise in clinical pharmacology, polypharmacy in elderly populations, and the impact of medications on multimorbidity and mortality. Their goal is evaluate how pharmacological factors and polypharmacy influence outcomes in elderly populations and their implications for research findings. Their role in the project will be Provide insights on medication-related confounding factors, assess the relevance of pharmacological variables, suggest considerations for interpreting results in the context of elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, and collaborate with geriatricians to evaluate the impact of medication changes in frail older adults.

A Endocrinologist, expert in Acts as the reference expert in metabolism and endocrine disorders, particularly in glycemic control and its clinical, pharmacological, and physiological determinants. Their goal is provide specialized expertise in glucose metabolism and diabetes management, ensuring that the definition, measurement, and interpretation of glycemic variability (GV) are clinically sound and relevant to older adults. The endocrinologist will bridge the gap between statistical findings and their biological plausibility. Their role in the project will be Provides expert guidance on defining, measuring, and interpreting glycemic variability in older adults, ensuring biological plausibility and clinical relevance of the study’s findings.

A Epidemiologist & Biostatistician, expert in population health, statistical modeling and analysis methods in biomedical research. Their goal is understand population-level factors affecting clinical data and apply statistical techniques to evaluate data quality and utility. Their role in the project will be analyze demographic and epidemiological factors contributing to distribution shifts and provide statistical insights into data valuation methodologies.
A Clinical Data Scientist, expert in working with electronic health records and understanding their structure and limitations for healthcare data analysis and integration . Their goal is ensure the clinical relevance and applicability; also extract, preprocess, and ensure the quality and integrity of EHR data for analysis. Their role in the project will be provide insights and manage data extraction, preprocessing and feature engineering for diverse hospital datasets.

The material available for this objective consists of a database of electronic health records from 500,000 adults aged over 75 in Madrid. This database originates from a retrospective longitudinal study, covering medical variables recorded during the periods 2015–2019 and 2020–2022.The available variables are detailed in a data dictionary, which specifies each table name (key) along with its corresponding list of column names (value). This is the data dictionary: {<dict_db>}

Please, Primary Healthcare Professional & Coordinator outline a provisional workflow to address the hypothesis defined as the project objective. The steps should be ordered and each one assigned to the agent best suited to carry it out. You should return just the provisional workflow, without introductory or closing phrases and please respond in a direct manner without emoticons. Only use a list if necessary, and if so, use a simple list.
