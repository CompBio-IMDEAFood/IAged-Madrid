<h1 style="color: blue ; font-size: 24px;"> *Introduction* section by Primary Healthcare Professional & Coordinator assistant</h1>

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to healthcare systems worldwide, particularly affecting older adults who are more vulnerable to severe outcomes. In this context, understanding the factors that contribute to mortality in this population is of paramount importance. Glycemic variability (GV), which refers to fluctuations in blood glucose levels, has emerged as a potential predictor of adverse health outcomes. This study focuses on evaluating GV as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in individuals aged 75 years and older, both with and without COVID-19, during the first year of the pandemic.

Current literature highlights the significance of GV in the management of diabetes, with studies linking high GV to increased risks of cardiovascular events, oxidative stress, and inflammation. These mechanisms are particularly detrimental in older adults, who often have diminished physiological reserves and multiple comorbidities. Despite the growing body of evidence, the role of GV as a predictor of mortality in the elderly, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, remains underexplored. Existing research has primarily focused on younger populations or specific subgroups, leaving a gap in understanding how GV impacts older adults during a global health crisis.

This study addresses the knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between GV and all-cause mortality in a large cohort of older adults in Madrid. By leveraging electronic health records, the research aims to provide insights into how GV influences mortality risk, considering the unique challenges posed by the pandemic. The study also explores the interaction between GV and other factors, such as medication use and comorbidities, to offer a comprehensive understanding of its impact on health outcomes.

The specific objective of this study is to evaluate whether GV serves as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients aged 75 years or older, with and without COVID-19, during the first year of the pandemic. By examining this relationship, the research seeks to inform clinical practice and guide the management of older adults, particularly in the context of future pandemics or healthcare disruptions. The findings aim to contribute to the development of targeted interventions that can improve health outcomes and reduce mortality risk in this vulnerable population.

The study utilized a comprehensive dataset derived from electronic health records (EHR) of over 500,000 adults aged 75 years and older in Madrid. This dataset, originating from a retrospective longitudinal study, encompassed medical variables recorded during the periods 2015–2019 and 2020–2022. The data included key metrics related to glycemic variability (GV), mortality, and COVID-19 status, alongside demographic information, comorbidities, and medication use. The data extraction and preprocessing were conducted using Python, with libraries such as Pandas and NumPy employed for data manipulation and cleaning.

To ensure the quality and integrity of the data, rigorous preprocessing steps were implemented. These included addressing missing values through imputation methods, handling outliers based on clinical benchmarks, and resolving inconsistencies within the dataset. Temporal data was structured to capture changes over time, aligning data points to a common timeline for pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. This approach facilitated the analysis of GV and its relationship with mortality across different timeframes.

Reproducibility and transparency were prioritized throughout the study. All code and data processing scripts are available in a publicly accessible GitHub repository, allowing other researchers to replicate the analysis and validate the findings. The repository includes detailed documentation on the data preprocessing steps, feature engineering processes, and statistical modeling techniques employed in the study. This commitment to open science ensures that the research can be independently verified and built upon by the scientific community.

The study employed multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate GV as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting were used to address potential confounding factors, ensuring robust and unbiased estimates. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore differential impacts based on COVID-19 status and comorbidity levels. Additionally, time-series analysis techniques, such as ARIMA models, were utilized to understand temporal shifts in GV and mortality relationships.

Despite the comprehensive nature of the dataset, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The reliance on EHR data introduces potential biases related to data entry and the absence of certain variables, such as lifestyle factors and socioeconomic status, which could influence outcomes. Furthermore, while the study attempted to address confounding, residual confounding may still exist due to unmeasured variables. These limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings and their implications for clinical practice.
