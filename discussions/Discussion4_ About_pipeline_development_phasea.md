This is the methodology defined in the last meeting:
Data Extraction and Preprocessing:
- Extract relevant data from EHR, focusing on glycemic variability (GV), mortality, and COVID-19 status.
- Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies using imputation methods and criteria for outlier handling.
- Structure temporal data to capture changes over time, aligning data points to a common timeline for pre-pandemic and pandemic periods.
- Implement data validation steps, including cross-checking against clinical benchmarks and using data visualization to identify anomalies.

Variable Selection:
- Focus on glucose and HBa1C metrics for GV, demographic variables (age, sex), comorbidities, and medication use.
- Consider potential confounders and create composite variables to account for interactions between GV and clinical factors.

Feature Engineering:
- Calculate variability metrics such as coefficients of variation and standard deviations for GV.
- Explore interaction terms and use machine learning techniques like decision trees to identify non-linear relationships.

Statistical Modeling:
- Use multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate GV as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality.
- Apply propensity score matching or inverse probability weighting to address confounding.
- Conduct subgroup analyses and stratify by key subgroups, such as COVID-19 status and comorbidity levels.
- Incorporate time-varying covariates and consider time-series analysis techniques like ARIMA or LSTM networks for temporal analysis.

Model Validation and Assumptions:
- Validate models and ensure assumptions are met, including checking proportional hazards in Cox models.
- Conduct sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of findings and explore different definitions of GV.

Integration and Collaboration:
- Continuous collaboration with clinical experts to ensure clinical relevance and interpretability of findings.
- Regular feedback loops with the clinical team to align analytical approaches with clinical priorities.
The material available for this objective consists of a database of electronic health records from 500,000 adults aged over 75 in Madrid. This database originates from a retrospective longitudinal study, covering medical variables recorded during the periods 2015–2019 and 2020–2022.
CSV files have been generated for each table from the database. Please consider using these files instead of connecting directly to the MySQL databaseThe available variables are detailed in a data dictionary, which specifies each table name (key) along with its corresponding list of column names (value). This is the data dictionary: {<dict_db>}

Epidemiologist & Biostatistician will convene the meeting.Throughout the working session, participants will share their perspectives and contributions in the following order: Epidemiologist & Biostatistician, Clinical Data Scientist, over 2 rounds. In the subsequent rounds, the participants will incorporate their colleagues’ comments to refine and reformulate their ideas. These rounds of discussion should conclude with the division and assignment of tasks, with clarity on which variables, statistical models, and tools will be used. You should make all relevant decisions for the development of the scripts, drawing on the literature and previous discussions, rather than seeking external support. After all team members have shared their perspectives, Epidemiologist & Biostatistician will compile a list of scripts names with python or R extension - according to the programming language choosen for each script- that will be developed.

Please, Epidemiologist & Biostatistician convene the collaborative working session. Keep in mind the objective: make decisions about the steps to follow, the script files to produce, and who will handle each part. Note that each script must be assigned to a single author (either the Epidemiologist & biostatician or the Clinical Data Scientist) and cannot be developed collaboratively.

## User

Clinical Data Scientist, please provide your discussion on how to break down and distribute the initial workflow for building the script pipeline, the programming language to use and how to assign responsibilities. Note that each script must be assigned to a single author (either the Epidemiologist & biostatician or the Clinical Data Scientist) and cannot be developed collaboratively. If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.  (round1/2)
