# Discussion 4: About pipeline development

## 4.b Formulate questions to the experts to solve doubts raised in variable selection

## User (Continue with thread 4)

This is the beginning of a working session to solve questions of variables metrics and develop the scripts to obtain the results.
Epidemiologist & Biostatistician will convene the meeting.Throughout the working session, participants will share their perspectives and contributions in the following order: Consultant in Geriatric Medicine, Clinical Pharmacology Specialist, Endocrinologist, Epidemiologist & Biostatistician, Clinical Data Scientist, over 1 rounds. In the subsequent rounds, the participants will incorporate their colleaguesâ€™ comments to refine and reformulate their ideas. Once all team members have given their input, the Epidemiologist & Biostatistician will consolidate all ideas in detail for future reference, to provide notes for the draft, and to serve as guidance for the developers

Please, Epidemiologist & Biostatistician, formulate the necessary questions based on the doubts raised in the meeting in order to achieve the objective

### Convening the Working Session

Welcome, team. Our goal today is to address questions related to variable metrics and develop scripts to obtain the results for our study on glycemic variability (GV) as an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in elderly patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Let's proceed with the session.

#### Questions for Discussion

1. **Consultant in Geriatric Medicine:**
   - How should we account for age-related factors and comorbidities when interpreting GV metrics in the elderly population?
   - Are there specific clinical benchmarks or thresholds for GV that are particularly relevant for geriatric patients?

2. **Clinical Pharmacology Specialist:**
   - What pharmacological factors should we consider as potential confounders in our analysis of GV and mortality?
   - How can we best account for polypharmacy and its impact on GV in our statistical models?

3. **Endocrinologist:**
   - What are the most clinically relevant metrics for measuring GV in older adults, and how should they be defined in our study?
   - Are there specific considerations for interpreting GV in the context of diabetes management in the elderly?

4. **Epidemiologist & Biostatistician (Myself):**
   - How can we ensure that our statistical models adequately capture the interaction between GV and other clinical factors?
   - What methods should we use to validate the robustness of our findings, particularly in the context of time-varying covariates?

5. **Clinical Data Scientist:**
   - What are the best practices for handling missing data and outliers in our dataset, particularly for GV and related variables?
   - How can we effectively structure our data to capture temporal changes and align with pre-pandemic and pandemic periods?

Once all team members have provided their input, I will consolidate the ideas and provide detailed notes for future reference. This will guide the development of our scripts and ensure that our analysis is comprehensive and clinically relevant.

Clinical Pharmacology Specialist, please provide your solve the questions asked by the Epidemiologist & Biostatistician to complete de code development. If you do not have anything new or relevant to add, you may say "pass". Remember that you can and should (politely) disagree with other team members if you have a different perspective.  (round1/1)

**Clinical Pharmacology Specialist:**

Thank you for the opportunity to address these questions. Here are my responses:

1. **Pharmacological Factors as Potential Confounders:**
   - **Consideration of Medications:** We should consider medications that directly affect glucose metabolism, such as insulin, sulfonylureas, and other antidiabetic drugs. Additionally, medications that may indirectly influence GV, such as corticosteroids or beta-blockers, should be included as potential confounders.
   - **Polypharmacy:** Given the high prevalence of polypharmacy in the elderly, we should account for the number of medications a patient is taking. This can be done by including a polypharmacy index or a count of medications in our models.

2. **Accounting for Polypharmacy and Its Impact on GV:**
   - **Interaction Terms:** We should explore interaction terms between GV and specific medication classes to understand how these drugs might modify the relationship between GV and mortality.
   - **Stratification:** Consider stratifying the analysis by key medication groups to assess differential impacts on GV and mortality outcomes.

These considerations will help ensure that our statistical models accurately reflect the complex interplay between pharmacological factors and GV in the elderly population. I look forward to seeing how these insights are integrated into the code development process.

Endocrinologist, please provide your solve the questions asked by the Epidemiologist & Biostatistician to complete de code development.

**Endocrinologist:**

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute. Here are my responses to the questions posed:

1. **Clinically Relevant Metrics for Measuring GV:**
   - **Metrics Selection:** The most clinically relevant metrics for measuring GV in older adults include the coefficient of variation (CV) of glucose levels, standard deviation (SD) of glucose readings, and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE). These metrics provide a comprehensive view of glucose fluctuations and are well-suited for capturing variability in an elderly population.
   - **Definition in Study:** In our study, GV should be defined using these metrics calculated from both fasting and postprandial glucose levels, as well as HbA1c variability over time.

2. **Considerations for Interpreting GV in Diabetes Management:**
   - **Context of Diabetes Management:** In older adults, GV interpretation should consider the presence of diabetes-related complications and the overall frailty of the patient. High GV may be more detrimental in those with existing complications or higher frailty.
   - **Clinical Relevance:** It is important to interpret GV in the context of individualized diabetes management goals, which may differ in older adults compared to younger populations. For instance, less stringent glycemic targets might be appropriate for some elderly patients to avoid hypoglycemia.

These insights should guide the development of our scripts to ensure that the analysis of GV is both clinically relevant and tailored to the needs of the older adult population. I look forward to seeing how these considerations are incorporated into the code development process.

Epidemiologist & Biostatistician, return a summary of the decissions maked regarding variable metrics, which variables to prioritize, and other relevant insights to consider before starting the code development phase. You should return just the a summary of decisions regarding variable metrics, which variables to prioritize, and other relevant insights to consider before starting the code development phase, without introductory or closing phrases and please respond in a direct manner without emoticons. Include  relevant comments and only use a list if necessary, and if so, use a simple list.

  - Calculate these metrics using both fasting and postprandial glucose levels, as well as HbA1c variability over time.

- **Pharmacological Factors:**
  - Include medications affecting glucose metabolism (e.g., insulin, sulfonylureas) and those indirectly influencing GV (e.g., corticosteroids, beta-blockers) as potential confounders.
  - Consider a polypharmacy index or medication count to account for the impact of multiple medications.

- **Interaction and Stratification:**
  - Explore interaction terms between GV and specific medication classes to assess their modifying effects on the relationship between GV and mortality.
  - Stratify analysis by key medication groups to evaluate differential impacts on GV and mortality outcomes.

- **Clinical Context for GV Interpretation:**
  - Consider the presence of diabetes-related complications and patient frailty when interpreting GV in older adults.
  - Align GV interpretation with individualized diabetes management goals, recognizing that less stringent glycemic targets may be appropriate for some elderly patients.

- **Data Handling:**
  - Address missing data and outliers, particularly for GV and related variables, using appropriate imputation methods.
