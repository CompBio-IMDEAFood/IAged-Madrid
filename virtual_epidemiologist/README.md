# Glycemic Variability and Mortality Study

This project evaluates whether glycemic variability (GV) is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients aged 75 years or older, with and without COVID-19, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Project Structure

- **raw_data/**: Contains the original input files (e.g., CSVs).
- **scripts/**: Contains all processing and analysis scripts.
- **output/**: Contains processed data, results, and figures.
- **docs/**: Contains documentation, notes, or metadata.
- **logs/**: Captures execution logs, if applicable.

## Scripts

1. **data_extraction_preprocessing.py**: Extracts and preprocesses data from raw CSV files.
2. **variable_selection.R**: Selects relevant variables for analysis.
3. **feature_engineering.py**: Performs feature engineering, including calculation of GV metrics.
4. **cox_modeling.R**: Fits a Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate GV as a predictor.
5. **model_validation.py**: Validates the Cox model and checks assumptions.
6. **temporal_analysis.py**: Conducts temporal analysis using ARIMA models.
7. **integration_collaboration.py**: Integrates results and compiles a comprehensive report.

## Requirements

### Python
- See `requeriments_python.txt` for Python package dependencies.

### R
- See `requeriments_r.txt` for R package dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure all dependencies are installed using the provided requirements files.
2. **Data Preparation**: Place raw CSV files in the `raw_data/` directory.
3. **Run Scripts**: Execute the scripts in the order listed above to process data and generate results.
4. **Review Results**: Check the `output/` directory for processed data, results, and figures. The comprehensive report is available in `docs/comprehensive_analysis_report.md`.

## Collaboration

This project involves continuous collaboration with clinical experts to ensure the clinical relevance and interpretability of findings. Feedback loops with geriatricians, pharmacologists, and endocrinologists are integral to the study.

## Future Directions

- Further exploration of non-linear relationships and interaction terms.
- Consideration of additional temporal analysis techniques.
- Ongoing collaboration with clinical teams to refine and validate findings.
